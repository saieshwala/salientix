        About Salientix
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg">
        Salientix is a software company focused on building intelligent systems
        that integrate naturally into real-world businesses.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg">
        We believe software should reduce complexity, not introduce it.
        The best systems feel invisible — reliable, secure and engineered
        to work quietly in the background.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg">
        Our work centers around AI-driven automation, decision-support systems,
        and scalable platforms designed for long-term use.
        We take a platform-first approach, allowing our products to grow
        alongside the businesses that rely on them.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg">
        Salientix is built with a long-term mindset.
        We prioritize engineering quality, security and clarity over short-term
        trends or surface-level innovation.
      </p>
